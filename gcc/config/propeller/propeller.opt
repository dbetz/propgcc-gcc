; options for the propeller

mspin
Target Mask(OUTPUT_SPINCODE) Report
Output spin wrapper code for the assembly language.

mcog
Target RejectNegative InverseMask(LMM) Report.
Generate code to run in internal cog space.

mlmm
Target RejectNegative Mask(LMM) Report
Generate for large memory model (LMM) (code and data in hub)

mcmm
Target RejectNegative Mask(CMM) Report
Generate for compressed memory model (CMM) (code and data in hub)

mxmmc
Target RejectNegative Mask(XMM_CODE) Report
Generate code to run in external memory (XMM); data is in hub. Implies -mlmm too.

mxmm
Target RejectNegative Mask(XMM) Report
Generate code to run in external flash/rom, with data in external ram.

mxmm-single
Target RejectNegative Mask(XMM_SINGLE) Report
Generate code to run in external memory, with data in external memory as well.

mxmm-split
Target RejectNegative Mask(XMM_SPLIT) Report
Generate code to run in external flash/rom, with data in external ram.

mpasm
Target Mask(PASM) Report
Generate assembler output that is compatible with the PASM assembler. The default is to generate GAS compatible syntax, unless -mspin is given.

m64bit-doubles
Target RejectNegative Mask(64BIT_DOUBLES) Report
Store doubles in 64 bits. This is the default.

m32bit-doubles
Target RejectNegative InverseMask(64BIT_DOUBLES) Report
Store doubles in 32 bits for faster and smaller code.

mfcache
Target Var(propeller_fcache_enable, 1) Init(-1) Report
Enable support for loading external code into the cog memory fcache.
This is enabled by default in optimization levels -O2 and higher, but
may be disabled with an explicit -mno-fcache.

mp2
Target RejectNegative Mask(P2) Report
Select Propeller 2 code generation.

mexperimental
Target Mask(EXPERIMENTAL)
Enable experimental optimizations which may or may not work correctly.
